# intro-csharp-tictactoe
Introductory presentation project to learn some C#. This project is a tic tac toe game as a windows console project to learn object oriented design concepts.


# Extended exercises

This was not a lesson on good game design, but rather how to evolve an application and OOP object model as usage requirements change.
